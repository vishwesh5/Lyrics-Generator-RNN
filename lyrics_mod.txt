I hear the drums echoing tonight But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation She's coming in, 12:30 flight The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation  I stopped an old man along the way Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies He turned to me as if to say "Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"  It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have Ooh ooh  The wild dogs cry out in the night As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company I know that I must do what's right As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti I seek to cure what's deep inside Frightened of this thing that I've become  It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have Ooh ooh  Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you  It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)  I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains) I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take some time) Gonna take some time to do the things we never have Ooh ooh Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce We were smoking a little from a half an ounce The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real Neither one of us looking for three little words Unless those three words was: Do not disturb Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in till three  She kept the hotel key Slipped it in her purse I guess it makes her think of me And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor We both no we can't open the door no more She kept the hotel key  Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone And danced by the TV we never turned on And wondered: Would anyone miss us if we ran away? But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no  She kept the hotel key Slipped it in her purse I guess it makes her think of me And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor We both no we can't open the door no more She kept the hotel key Yeah  Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh  We left the lights We left the crowd We left the world and locked it out She left a picture in my head She left the night I can't forget, but  She kept the hotel key Slipped it in her purse I guess, it makes her think of me And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor We both know we can't open the door no more She kept the hotel key  Yeah She kept it  She kept the hotel key Slipped it in her purse I guess, it makes her think of me And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor We both know we can't open the door no more She kept the hotel key  Yeah, she kept it She kept the hotel key Ooh She kept the hotel key  Writer (s): Josh Osborne, Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen Who am I that the highest King Would welcome me I was lost but He brought me in Oh His love for me Oh His love for me  Who the Son sets free Oh is free indeed I'm a child of God Yes I am  Free at last He has ransomed me His grace runs deep While I was a slave to sin Jesus died for me Yes He died for me  Who the Son sets free Oh is free indeed I'm a child of God Yes I am In my Father's house There's a place for me I'm a child of God Yes I am  I am chosen, not forsaken I am who You say I am You are for me, not against me I am who You say I am I am chosen, not forsaken I am who You say I am You are for me, not against me I am who You say I am I am who You say I am  Who the Son sets free Oh is free indeed I'm a child of God Yes I am In my Father's house There's a place for me I'm a child of God Yes I am In my Father's house There's a place for me I'm a child of God Yes I am Another head hangs lowly Child is slowly taken And the violence causes silence Who are we mistaken?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in Sometimes I feel like giving up No medicine is strong enough Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin Sometimes I feel like giving up But I just can't It isn't in my blood  It isn't in my blood  Looking through my phone again feeling anxious Afraid to be alone again, I hate this I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh Is there somebody who could...  Help me, it's like the walls are caving in Sometimes I feel like giving up No medicine is strong enough Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin Sometimes I feel like giving up But I just can't It isn't in my blood  It isn't in my blood  I need somebody now I need somebody now Someone to help me out I need somebody now  Help me, it's like the walls are caving in Sometimes I feel like giving up But I just can't It isn't in my blood  It isn't in my blood It isn't in my blood I need somebody now It isn't in my blood I need somebody now It isn't in my blood I still walk in that bar a little drunk I still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name I still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2 a.m. Even though we break up in the end  I'll introduce you to my mom and dad Say "I think I love her" when you leave that room I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in Even though we break up in the end  Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away I'd still go back and get you Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake Oh, I'd still make it with you Over and over, again and again Even though we break up in the end  I'd still play my favorite song in your car Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it Even though we break up in the end  Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away I'd still go back and get you Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake Girl, I'd still make it with you Over and over, again and again Even though we break up in the end  You've just had one too many tonight You're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay But you know if you come over, I can't not let you in Even though we'll break up in the end I'd do it over and over, again and again Even though we break up in the end Can't stop thinking about if and when I die For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow We're surrounded and we're hounded There's no above, or under, or around it For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see For if and when we go above, the question still remains Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same? And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder But until that time, I'll try to sing this  If I keep moving, they won't know I'll morph to someone else What they throw at me's too slow I'll morph to someone else I'm just a ghost I'll morph to someone else Defense mechanism mode  He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki He's got no friends close but those who know him most know He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded There's no above or a secret door What are we here for If not to run straight through all our tormentors? But until that time, I'll try to sing this  If I keep moving, they won't know I'll morph to someone else What they throw at me's too slow I'll morph to someone else I'm just a ghost I'll morph to someone else Defense mechanism mode  I'll morph to someone else Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes Count to infinity, ones and zeroes I'm surrounded and I'm hounded There's no above, or under, or around it For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see For if and when we go above, the question still remains Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same? And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder But until that time I'll morph to someone else I'm just a ghost  If I keep moving, they won't know I'll morph to someone else What they throw at me's too slow I'll morph to someone else I'm just a ghost I'll morph to someone else Defense mechanism mode If I keep moving, they won't know I'll morph to someone else Defense mechanism mode I'll morph to someone else  Not done, not done Not done, Josh Dun I'll morph to someone else Hey  Havana, ooh na-na (ay) Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)  He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na All of my heart is in Havana (ay) There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh) Havana, ooh na-na  He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
