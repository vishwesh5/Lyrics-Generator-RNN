Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-ha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
Will you hold the line
When every one of them is giving up or giving in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up

'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world

Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Call out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache, cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up

'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world

Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural
Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I die
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling, baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
Then I'm just a dead man walking tonight
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said
Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

Mama said
It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes

Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don't want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm

Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

So pull me up from down below
'Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown (keep my head above water, above water)

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Keep my head above water, above water
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the song of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And You say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, o-ooh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
And You say I am held when I am falling short
And when I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure God, You have every victory, o-ooh

You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe, oh I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Oh, I believe, yes I believe
What You say of me
I believe
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away, away with me

Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now

He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I think that you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

Oh, you know it, baby
Sittin' in a parked car
We don't even fight no more
We don't even touch no more
Used to be my best friend
We don't even laugh no more
Barely even talk no more

You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me running and running around

If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please

I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight

We used to go out on dates
Now you don't wanna go no place
Feels like we're stuck in one place
I wish I could read your mind
Instead I gotta read your eyes
Oh, how they tell me lies

You wanna hold my hand and then you won't
You say you love me then you don't
You keep me running and running around

If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please

I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight

Se-se-set me free, le-le-let me be
I'm down, down on my knees (I'm down, down on my knees)
Se-se-set me free, le-le-let me be
I'm down, down on my knees

If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees
If you're not the one for me
Then just let me be
I'm begging you, please

I'm praying for closed doors and open windows
I'll follow where the wind blows
Don't be scared to leave
If I'm not all you need
Then just set me free
I'm down on my knees, tonight
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, Nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging onto the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough from the particle sum
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased

At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

Whatever it takes
Ya take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find
It's true the road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

It's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history; an epiphany
That all we need is us

It's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin' love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin' love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long

She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

She got the best of me
She got the best of me
She got the best of me
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swear

Oh but hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

Fortuneteller told me
"No more last chances
You got no future at all"
Oh but I ain't listening
To black-hearted gypsy
Then a crucifix to a bedroom wall

But hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt, don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah flashing light, caution, careful where ya cross son, till she comes back again

But now hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

Oh hey (hey), I said hey (hey)
Whoa what can I say, I'm a desperate man
Oh hey (hey), I said hey (hey)
I'm just a desperate man

Grown-ass man
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

I met you late night, at a party
Some trustfund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said, "Let's talk."
But my confidence is wearing off

These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face
And that's when she said

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has it's consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time

Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said I'm no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind

Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

You say you're basic, you say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder
Thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (feel the)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder

Thunder, thunder, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Spent 24 hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

Now it's all good, babe
Roll that back wood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through

Girls like you love fun and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh

Now it's all good, babe

And play me close

Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe you're thinking it's better if you drive

Oh, 'cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown when I come through

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I can still shut down a party
I can hang
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority T-Shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila

I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk
And I'm thinking
How I need your love, how I need your love
Yeah, it sinks in

When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Sorority t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that dress fall off you is amazing
You're a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking

Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful (yeah)
Yeah...

That little ringing buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby, I swear

I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Let's start with them Luke Caseys, baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
And bobby pins holding your hair up, girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hanging off your shoulder as you move a little close
Yeah, let's lose it tonight, yeah girl

I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flipping your hair, baby I swear

I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat tonight
Close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancing, swaying to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('Cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding?
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the east side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Third floor on the west side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you)
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)

Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?
Yeah

Maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide (oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's okay
I promise myself one day
Hey!

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before (ain't nothing like before)
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

And that's okay (baby, now, that's okay)
I promised myself one day
Hey!

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am

I'ma tell 'em all (that's just the way I am)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
(That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am

Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along
Everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide
Hey!

I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
(Maybe I'ma get a little anxious, maybe I'ma get a little scared)
That's just the way I am, that's just the way I am
('Cause everybody's trying to be famous)

I'ma tell 'em all
(That's just the way I am)
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
(That's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am
Her day starts with a coffee
Ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready
She's never on time for anything

She gets that come get me
Look in her eyes
It kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
She drives me wild

Beautiful crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me

She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says "let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

Beautiful crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me

She unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her

Beautiful crazy

The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
She's crazy
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me
I'm not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are

But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become

Won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
Gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

...This is me

And I know that I deserve your love
There's nothing I'm not worthy of
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
This is brave, this is bruised
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

I'm gonna send a flood
Gonna drown them out
(...This is me)
I'm trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling without you

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
For me
For me
For me

All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but it'll
Never be enough
Never be enough

For me
Never, never
Never, never
Never, for me
For me

For me

Ooh, yeah, yeah

So I don't go shootin' where your heart be
'Cause you take the bullet tryna save me
Then I'm left to deal with makin' you bleed

And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' 'em out and never make it
That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna face it

But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'

You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (trippin' on you)

That's some kind of love, baby (trip, trip)
That's the type of love, make me (trip, trip, trippin' on you)

It's big enough, got me (trip, trip, tripping on you)

Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you

My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (trippin' on you)
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

My friends say no-o, no-o-o
Then they don't know
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know
No-o, no-o-o
No, no

And I say no, oh, oh
And I say no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know, oh
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-ha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
Half your life you struggle
Half your life you fly
Half your life makin' trouble
Half your life makin' it right
One day I'm the exception
Most days I'm just like most
Some days I'm headed in the right direction
And some days I ain't even close

I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man

I always loved the highway
I just don't run it as fast
I still go wherever the wind blows me
But I always find my way back
I still don't get it right sometimes
I just don't get it as wrong
I still go a little bit crazy sometimes
Yeah, but now I don't stay near as long

I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Burning man

Maybe I'll go to the desert
Find myself in the Joshua Tree
If we pass in the night then just hand me a light
And tell me you burned just like me

I'm a little bit steady but still little bit rollin' stone
I'm a little bit heaven but still a little bit flesh-and-bone
Little found, little don't-know-where-I-am
I'm a little bit holy water but still a little bit burning man
Burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man
Still just a burn, burn, burning man
Just a burning man

Just a burning man
Burning man, burning man
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking

Damn

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time
'Cause I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you

I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you, swear the room-yeah-it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something

Damn

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time
'Cause I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you

Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Right here with me
Yeah, yeah

I like me better when I'm with you
(Yes, I do, yes, I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time
'Cause I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you

I like me, I like me
Look who you made me, made me, oh no
Better when

I like me better when I'm with you
First things first
I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
Who looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
You rained down, like

Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my god, they came from
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

I swear you're and angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

Come kiss me one more time
When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light and go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you

Surrounded and up against a wall
I'll shred 'em all and go with you
When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat and go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

You don't need to run
You don't need to run

If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin

And go with you, I'll go with you

Whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and this sad ol' song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

Whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

By a couple guys that didn't treat me right

I don't even care, I need a photo with Drake, because my Instagram is weak as fuck
What are you talkin' about?
I'm just being real, my shit look
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of two thousand and two
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing "love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to two thousand and two
Yeah

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love
On the day we fell in love, love, love
Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone

The South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea diving round the clock, bikini bottoms, Lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone

We got too little fun
Too little that
We got two in the front
Two in the back

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of
If you need me you know were I'll be

I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
I'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feeling like I'm someone
They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That made me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In a beat up car with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say, "That boy is sure living in luxury, sweet luxury."

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
And that made me a millionaire

When her kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up

Yeah, we turnin' it up
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Oh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Looking at you, I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless of my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I could go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning
'Cause it's still burning

So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me
No

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

Woah
Oh have mercy

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmm if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, eh, eh, ey
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, eh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all this worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
Like a rainy Sunday morning makes me want to stay in bed
Twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl you take me places
Put the words right into these songs

Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

Stealing kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me

You make it easy
Lovin' up on you
Make it easy
With every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You make it easy
Yeah, feelings, so deep in my feelings
No, this ain't really like me
Can't control my anxiety
Feeling, like I'm touching the ceiling
When I'm with you I can't breathe
Boy you do something to me

Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up

Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

Oh how, how many ways can I say that I need you, baby, it's true
I think I might die without you
Feeling all over my body
You know how I like it
Ain't gotta tell you what to do, yeah yeah

Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

Listen to my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up

Head over heels in love

And everything you want, you ain't gotta ask for

Boo'd up, boo'd up
Told you from the jump I'm the one to choose

Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

This is such a crazy feeling, like
I don't want to get too attached, but
I feel like I already am
My mind's telling me one thing, but
I guess I should listen to my heart
Right?
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)

I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take some time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh
Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words was: Do not disturb
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in till three

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both no we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
And danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered: Would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both no we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah
She kept it

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Ooh
She kept the hotel key

Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me

Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

Free at last He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me

Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am

I am chosen, not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me, not against me
I am who You say I am
I am chosen, not forsaken
I am who You say I am
You are for me, not against me
I am who You say I am
I am who You say I am

Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are crying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

It's the same old theme in 2018
In your head, in your head, they are dying

What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

In your head
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

Looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I still walk in that bar a little drunk
I still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name
I still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2 a.m.
Even though we break up in the end

I'll introduce you to my mom and dad
Say "I think I love her" when you leave that room
I'd still not take their advice when I say you're moving in
Even though we break up in the end

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Oh, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

I'd still play my favorite song in your car
Let you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours
Now all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it
Even though we break up in the end

Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away
I'd still go back and get you
Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake
Girl, I'd still make it with you
Over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end

You've just had one too many tonight
You're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay
But you know if you come over, I can't not let you in
Even though we'll break up in the end
I'd do it over and over, again and again
Even though we break up in the end
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode

He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode

I'll morph to someone else
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
Defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else

Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar (azúca')

If I had a dollar every time that I swore you off
And a twenty every time that I picked up when you called
And a crisp new Benjamin for when you're here then gone again
And a dollar every time I was right about you after all

Boy I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No I wouldn't be covered in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling on your lips
Is money falling from the sky... shit I'd be rich
I'd be rich

If I had a dime every time that you crossed my mind
Well I'd basically be sitting on a big ass pile of dimes
And all the times that you make my heart feel cheap
I might as well have won the lottery
All of this pain and me cursing your name
Would just turn into dollar signs

'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No I wouldn't be covered in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling on your lips
Is money falling from the sky... shit I'd be rich
I'd be rich

Told myself I wouldn't do this again
But how much you wanna bet I'mma do this again?

'Cause I'd be rich, head to toe Prada
Benz in the driveway, yacht in the water
Vegas at the Mandarin, high roller gambling
Me and Diddy drippin' diamonds like Marilyn
No I wouldn't be covered in all your IOU's
Every promise you made me would have some real value
'Cause all the little lies rolling on your lips
Is money falling from the sky... shit I'd be rich
I'd be rich

I'd be rich
I'd be rich
I was born in a town full of red pine trees
County sign says "follow your dreams"
Westbound train makes the whole town shake
Friday night lights decide your fate

Born again in a church where the steeple's white
Preacher preach Book of John and my momma cried
Meaning of life was in verse 2
Didn't make sense 'til I found you

I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

I was a wild child between lost and found
Then you spoke my name, it was a sweet sound
Rescue kiss and you pulled me in
All my life baby, where you been

'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you

'Cause I could search the world from south to north
But I've already found what I'm looking for
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
Looking in your eyes, yeah it's all so clear
Every time you smile, I know why I'm here
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
1, 2, 3

All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again

And I know you claim
That you're alright
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

But don't just slip away
In the night
Don't just hurl
Your words from on high

Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

If we come back and we're broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we'll go your way

'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint in that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You roll in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little back sun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ay

I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
Till the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah

Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna disconnect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, why am I so lonely?

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Good friends, good friends hard to find, let's face it
Bought the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now and I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about at maybe 40
Years and I'll be ready and willing, be able to edit the story
'Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Lonely

Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, I'm searching for the real thing
Met somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Tryna find the old me
Lonely
